Structure of the code was borrowed from boiler plate found online. 
Sources, such as W3 Schools and Stack overflow, were referenced to figure out 
minor details such as linking buttons to different html pages and box shadowing 
when hovering over these links.

Javascript was used to create a box shadow effect when mouse hovers over navigation bar
links and creates a "delay" in loading the page to get that transition like effect. There
is no separate javascript file, code was just embedded in the index.html file.
